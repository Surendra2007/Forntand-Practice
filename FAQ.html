                <p>Frontend Practice offers developers the opportunity to practice and improve their skills in design, interactions, animations, responsiveness, troubleshooting, and more by providing a selection of real websites for them to recreate from scratch. This hands-on approach allows developers to gain a diverse set of valuable skills that will make them more employable in the industry.</p>

                <p>The selection of websites featured on Frontend Practice is based on personal preference and takes into consideration various factors, including design and style, difficulty to recreate, and elements and features that offer a learning opportunity through recreation.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important to note that some projects may be more challenging to recreate than others.</p>

                <p>How dare they update the website! We will talk with their manager right away. If they don't respond, we'll periodically check the websites we feature and make the necessary updates.
                    <br><br>
                    In some cases, if we really love the previous design, we may keep it and link to an archived page if possible. If not, please see the reference image on the project page.</p>
